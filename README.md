# Graduate-project-2019

This respository contains an assortment of various, computer science graduate-level, programming assignments.
Graduates in the program are to complete an assignment once every two weeks and have a new developer within IAG code review and confirm compilation.

The intention is to learn from these basics as well as how to reach out for help amongst the organisation - we all need a hand sometimes.
A screen shot from the developer or engineer will suffice as evidence.

After 10 projects we will be using the skills learned on a group project to be revealed.
